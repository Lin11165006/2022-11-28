摘要：  
In this work we present a methodology to detect rare events which are defined as large price movements relative to the volume traded. We analyze the behavior of equity after the detection of these rare events. We provide methods to calibrate trading rules based on the detection of these events and illustrate for a particular trading rule. We apply the methodology to tick data for thousands of equities over a period of five days. In order to draw comprehensive conclusions, we group the equities into classes and calculate probabilities of price recovery after these rare events for each class. The methodology that we have developed is based on non-parametric statistics and makes no assumption about the distribution of the random variables in the study.

1. 套入pandas、numpy、yfinance  
2. 利用yfinance套件將'AAPL'近一年的資料載入，將收盤日期'Date'取消索引並移到Columns裡。
3. 設定一個data，將"Close", "Volume", "Date" 加入 data的Columns裡。  
5. 分別將"Close", "Volume", "Date" 個別定義為close, volume, dat，以便後面找尋日期使用。
6. 將V0設定為平均數。  
7. 計算![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119159610/204538794-ae57522f-5458-4de7-8932-943f3cc577bb.gif) 有兩種方法：  
      -利用 pandas套件裡的.sum()  
      -利用迴圈算出
